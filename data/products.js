    description: `The Atlantic Cod is part of the Gadidae family and is primarly hunted for food by humans. It is labeled as vulnerable by the ICUN due to over-fishing for human consumption. It can live up to 25 years and comes in green or brown colors with spots on the dorsal side.
    It lives in habitats from the main continental shelf to the shoreline, which is why it is easier to catch in all sorts of waters. They usually have a length of 61 cm to 1.2 m and weigh up to 40 kg.`,
